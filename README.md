# COVID-19 Analysis with SQL, Excel, and Tableau

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the global spread of COVID-19 across regions, countries, and continents over time. Using data from Our [World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), the goal was to understand how the pandemic evolved worldwide and to present the findings through interactive visualizations.
## Objectives
- Track COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
- Compare the impact across different regions and countinents.
- Provide insights through a clear and interactive Tableau dashboard.
## Data Source
- **Dataset**: [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- Covers daily updates on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics.
## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Initial data cleaning, splitting into structured files for queries.
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation for analysis.
- **Tableau**: Building interactive dashboards and visualizations. 
## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation (Excel):**
   - Imported the dataset and performed cleaning.
   - Created separate Excel files to simplify querying.
2. **Data analysis (SQL):**
   - Extracted key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and rates.
   - Aggregated data at regional and continental levels.
3. **Visualization (Tableau):**
   - Developed dashboards to highlight trends and insights.
   - Included maps, timelines, and comparison charts.

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Key Findings
- Europe and North America experienced early and sharp peaks in cases and deaths.
- Asia showed varied trends, with some countries controlling the spread earlier than others.
- Africa reported lower case counts overall, though underreporting and limited testing may have influenced results.
- The global trend revealed multiple waves, with significant spikes during late 2020 and mid-2021.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data from multiple sources can be cleaned, structured, and analyzed using a combination of Excel, SQL, and Tableau. 
The analysis highlights the global and regional patterns of COVID-19 spread, showing that the pandemic affected continents in distinct ways and evolved through multiple waves. 
By leveraging SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, the project transforms raw data into actionable insights that can be explored interactively.
